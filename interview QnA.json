                        "answer": "Credential stuffing and password spraying are both attack techniques used to gain unauthorized access to accounts, but they differ in their approach: 1. Credential Stuffing: In credential stuffing, attackers use large sets of username-password pairs obtained from previous data breaches and attempt to log in to multiple online accounts using these pairs. The goal is to exploit users who reuse passwords across different services. Detection: Detection involves monitoring login attempts for a high number of failed login events from various IP addresses using known username-password combinations. 2. Password Spraying: Password spraying involves trying a small number of commonly used passwords against a large number of usernames. Attackers hope to find weak or default passwords that may be shared among multiple users. Detection: Detection focuses on identifying repeated login attempts with different usernames but a limited set of passwords. Both techniques can be detected by analyzing authentication logs, rate limiting login attempts, and implementing account lockout policies."

                        "answer": "In a password spraying attack use-case, an attacker targets a corporate network's Outlook Web Access (OWA) portal, which is accessible externally. The attacker's goal is to gain unauthorized access to corporate email accounts. Here's how the attack unfolds: 1. Reconnaissance: The attacker identifies the OWA portal's URL and collects a list of potential usernames. They may obtain this list from publicly available sources or by scraping employee names from the company's website and social media profiles. 2. Password List: The attacker compiles a shortlist of common or default passwords commonly used within the organization, such as 'Password123' or 'Welcome123.' 3. Password Spraying: The attacker uses an automated script to attempt login with each username-password combination from the shortlist, starting with the first username and cycling through the passwords. 4. Low and Slow: To avoid detection, the attacker performs the attack at a slow rate to stay under the radar of account lockout policies and intrusion detection systems. 5. Success: If the attacker discovers a valid username-password combination, they gain unauthorized access to the victim's email account. This access can be used for further reconnaissance, data theft, or launching additional attacks within the organization."
